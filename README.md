# OC0

OC0 is a collection of small tools which you can use to do some of simple tasks without needing to do comples things such as finding a good font or editing an image.

## About The Project

This is the project that I worked on for a neighborhood. It's divided into two different parts, one with 44 hours for 2 tools. Out of the 60 hours for this part, 15 hours were for the Figma designs. I was unable to copy them exactly because the functionality and the look were not going hand in hand.

The live version of the project is ready and you can check it out at https://oc0.io 

### Important Notes
*   **Dark Theme:** If you use a dark theme for the fonts tool, you will need to change the color of the text from `#000000` to `#ffffff` to see the changes.
*   **Image Editor UI:** The UI for the image editor does not look how it looks in the Figma files. I tried to create custom selectors, but they lag a lot on smaller screens.
*   **Project Scope:** Note that oc0 was originally a collection of 4 tools, which I reduced to 2. I plan to use the others for other projects. The total time for all of this was 104 hours, as I was planning to make oc0 a personal site at first (which you can also see in the Figma file). I also need to ship some parts which I never did because of travel.
